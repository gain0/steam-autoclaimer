welcome to the only free public (and proxyless) steam autoclaimer, as of 12/27/2023.

to prep the program for running, first run the requirements installer. 
once this is done, you may delete that and the requirements.txt file.

after this, the program is ready to run! 

- to set it up for claiming, open your steam profile on either the applciation or browser, click edit on your profile,
delete the text for the steamid that you currently have, and leave that page open with the cursor flashing on that text box.
- you may run the steamid or steamgroup url claimer, and from there you should input the file name 
(including .txt) of the list that you would like to claim from.
- immediately after, go back into your page where you are editing your steam profile, and make sure that the cursor is still flashing.
- when a username is available to claim, it will enter it, and type it into the box, pressing enter immediately after it is done,
so that it ensures that you have claimed the name.

make sure that you are running the claimer, and not the checker (unless you intend to only use the checking feature).

you may also create your own .txt lists, as long as they are separated by line breaks! include them into this folder.

i have also included a steam group url checker as well, (doesn't include claiming features).

things to note:
- you may have false positives if your list has any of the following issues
	- text has a space at the beginning or end of your line
	- text includes characters other than alphanumeric, or - and _
- some profiles may include text to generate a false positive. remove those items from the list.
- this is not a tool to swap your steamid. please do not use it for that. you will likely lose your steamid.
- this tool doesn't use any proxies. this is fine for checking urls, but when you claim them you will need to use a new account
every time that you claim id (incase you get one you aren't satisfied with), and after a while you will need to use a proxy/vpn.

thank you for taking the time to read the instructions! i hope you make use of this tool, as i have over the years!
